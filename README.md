# minnow
A compression algorithm for cosmological N-body simulations

## Insallation

First, we need to download the code. To do this clone the `minnow` repository using the normal steps, and download libraries it depends on with the command
```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Next, compile the library with `make`. You can run tests with `make test` if you want (recommended).
